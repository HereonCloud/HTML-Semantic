            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
            <p>I'm started my journey as an Electronics engineer then shifted her career to web development. Why?
                because I love to consistently learn and be challenged and and I love solving problems. I always wanted
                to create
                possible solutions and prototypes that I can think of and that led me to web development. Currently, I
                am working as a full-stack
                developer and still continue to learn different frameworks and technologies.</p>
